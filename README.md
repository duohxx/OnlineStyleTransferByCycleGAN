# OnlineStyleTransferByCycleGAN

- Achieved the communication between front end and back end by Ajax;
- Designed a deep neural network, which AI algorithm is CycleGAN. The AI framework is PyTorch. This neural network can achieve the style transfer;
- trained three different kinds of AI models, respective Van Goghâ€™s painting style, abstract painting style and kiwi fruit style with CUDA; 
- implemented a simple back end by using Node.js;
- Achieved upload and download images from AWS S3 by aws-sdk tool.
Key skill: Deep Learning, CycleGAN, Pytorch (python), Node.js, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
